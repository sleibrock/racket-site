  (h1 "What is this site?")
  (p "This is a website I created written entirely in Racket, after being frustrated for years of having to use Python for everything.")

  (h1 "Why Racket?")
  (p "Racket is a fun language that allows you to explore creative solutions to problems. It also has great concurrency with their green threading model. Racket is a dialect of Scheme, so if you know how to write Lisp or Scheme, you'll feel right at home with Racket.")

  (h1 "Where is this hosted?")
  (p "It currently resides in \"The Cloud&trade;\". I'm using a Google Compute Engine VM to run this Racket server that I've created. It indefinitely handles and routes requests properly.")

  (h1 "Is it Open-Sourced?")
  (p "Yes!")

  (h1 "Do you recommend it?")
  (p "Probably not. At this level of programming, not many things are handled for you. Cookies aren't magically handled, request variables and parameters aren't magically parsed into views. Adding new views currently is a pretty painful process if you don't understand the code. I didn't create this to create the next-best web framework for professionals to use in their eCommerce and CMS products, unfortunately. I just created this server because I was simply bored and wanted a better grasp of the lowest level possible.")))
